Welcome to my project exploring visualization of Neural Networks!

The Problem: This model classifies screenshots of Battlefield4 by map. 

The Architecture: The model consists of 7 Conv2D layers of size 5 kernels, and 2 Linear layers. There are currently 6 BF4 maps: {Dawnbreaker,Floodzone,Silk Road,Siege of Shanghai,Lost Islands, Zavod 311}
